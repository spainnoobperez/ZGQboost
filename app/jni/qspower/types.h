/**
 *  Data structure for capturing the current goal performance since

 *                    last <code>qspower_set_goal()</code>.
 *                    Note: each <code>qspower_regulate()</code> call marks the
 *                    start of a new regulation step and the completion of
 *                    the prior regulation step.
 *  - goal_fraction : the fraction of regulation steps where the desired
 *                    goal was achieved within the specified tolerance.
 *  - mean_squared_error : the mean squared error in achieving the desired goal
 *                    over the regulation steps.
 *  - normalized_mserror : the mean-squared error normalized by the tolerance value.
